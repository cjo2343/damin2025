# Lecture #02: Introduction to Python Programming Language

This folder contains the supporting materials used during **Lecture #02** of the Data Mining KSD course (Autumn 2025) **on 02 September 2025**.

## Overview

This lecture introduces fundamental Python programming concepts essential for data mining and analysis. The materials progress from basic Python syntax to data manipulation using popular libraries like Pandas.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

- Understand Python syntax and basic programming constructs
- Work with different data types (strings, numbers, lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Implement control flow structures (conditionals and loops)
- Create and use functions
- Perform basic data manipulation with Pandas
- Load and analyze CSV data files
- Calculate basic statistical measures

## Course Materials

### Interactive Jupyter Notebooks

The main learning materials are provided as interactive Jupyter notebooks that combine explanations, code examples, and exercises:
