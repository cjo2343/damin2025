    "# While Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of `while` loops in Python. While loops are essential programming constructs that repeatedly execute code blocks as long as a specified condition remains true.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand the syntax and structure of `while` loops\n",
    "- Learn the difference between `for` loops and `while` loops\n",
    "- Practice creating condition-controlled loops\n",
    "- Understand how to avoid infinite loops\n",
    "- Use `break` and `continue` statements effectively\n",
    "- Apply while loops to solve practical problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are While Loops?\n",
    "\n",
    "While loops continue to execute a block of code as long as a given condition is `True`. Unlike for loops that iterate over a sequence, while loops are condition-based and are particularly useful when you don't know in advance how many iterations you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code to execute while condition is True\n",
    "    # Don't forget to update the condition!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always ensure the condition can eventually become `False`, or you'll create an infinite loop!"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Structure**: `while condition:` repeats as long as condition is True\n",
    "2. **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Always ensure the condition can become False\n",
    "3. **Update Variables**: Remember to modify variables that affect the condition\n",
    "4. **Break Statement**: Use `break` to exit loops early\n",
    "5. **Continue Statement**: Use `continue` to skip to the next iteration\n",
    "6. **Input Validation**: While loops are perfect for validating user input\n",
    "7. **Unknown Iterations**: Use while loops when you don't know how many iterations you need\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always update loop variables** that affect the condition\n",
    "2. **Use meaningful variable names** for conditions\n",
    "3. **Consider using `for` loops** if you know the iteration count\n",
    "4. **Add safety counters** to prevent accidental infinite loops in complex scenarios\n",
    "5. **Use `break` and `continue`** to make your logic clearer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Try creating programs that:\n",
    "- Implement a guessing game with attempts limit\n",
    "- Validate user input until correct format is entered\n",
    "- Process data until a specific condition is met\n",
    "- Create a simple text-based adventure game\n",
    "- Build a basic ATM simulation with menu options\n",
    "- Implement a password strength checker that keeps asking until requirements are met\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forgetting to update the loop variable** ‚Üí infinite loop\n",
    "2. **Incorrect condition logic** ‚Üí loop never executes or never stops\n",
    "3. **Using while loop when for loop is more appropriate** ‚Üí unnecessary complexity\n",
    "4. **Not handling edge cases** in the condition ‚Üí unexpected behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Master these concepts, and you'll be able to create robust, condition-controlled programs!"
